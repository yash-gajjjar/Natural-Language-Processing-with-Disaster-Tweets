# Disaster-Tweets-Twitter-Prediction

### About

This project is part of a Kaggle competition that focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify tweets into disaster-related or not disaster-related. The dataset consists of 10,000 hand-labeled tweets. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a tweet is announcing a disaster or not.

The challenge is to distinguish between tweets that use disaster-related terms metaphorically and those that describe real events. The project evaluates the model's performance using the F1 score, which balances precision and recall.
